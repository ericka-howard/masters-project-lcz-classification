    * [x] <del>Clip image to cover city </del>*Using contest data*
    * [x] <del>Figure out what ENVI FLAASH is </del>*Using contest data*
    * [x] <del>Read about bilinear reampling with spatial data </del>*Only for curiosity sake, using contest data*
* [ ] Solidify plan of attack for data preprocessing

### Week 2 (Jan. 11-15)

* [ ] Schedule Oral Exam 
* [ ] Start writing background info/introduction
* [ ] Go through 2+ random forest resources
* [ ] Data preprocessing steps
     * [x] Determine how you get raster data into R.
     * [ ] How can you get the raster data to be a data frame (& does it even make sense to do that?)
     * [ ] Determine how you choose to only use certain bands as input data? Can you just filter it? 
     * [ ] Strategize how to randomly and evenly divide the polygons. Test if time allows
