```

Definitely didn't work and was just for testing (to see if I could go through the tutorial code with my data) anyway, so scrap it.

Tomorrow:
1. Why did they give us the data as a tif instead of a shp file? Is that advantageous?
2. If it's not, how do I convert it to a point shapefile?
3. Watch WUDAPT video
