- The Urban Heat Island effect is where urbanized areas are warmer than neighboring rural areas

- As the population worldwide increases and urbanizes this is a major concern,
because these heat islands cause increased energy consumption, elevated emissions of air pollutants
and greenhouse gasses, compromised human health and comfort, and impaired water quality.

- That's what you can see here in this generalized profile. Notice that our y-axis is degrees celsius, so these changes can be quite large.

- So, what can be done about them?
- Well we know that they are caused because urban built structures hold more heat than the structures and vegetation in surrounding areas.  You can see this in the profile. 

- Knowledge about microclimates within cities can be incredibly useful in mitigating this issue because it can give information about prospective sites for climate risk adaptation. 

- Unfortuately this information can be difficult to obtain.

- One way to find these microclimates is by classification of satellite imagery

Here you can see one of the predominant classification schemes for urban areas.

- On the outside circle are the urban classes, they range from 1 to 10 and include varying levels of built structures. It's roughly grouped into high-rises, mid-rises, low-rises, sparsely built, and heavy industry.

- On the inside circle are the natural classes, which range from A to G and include trees, bushes and low plants, bare soil rock or sand, and water.

- Moving forward I'll talk about the natural classes as classes 11-17 rather than A-G.

# Objective

* mention motivation is to replicate Yoo + brief description [[building models to predict lcz based on satellite data]]
* do this for HK
* use RFs
* ntree


???
maybe mention that this method is how WUDAPT does it

# The LCZ reference data

mention that the gmap is for context and I wasn't using it

# The Landsat 8 data

#### switch to just one landsat band & keep track of what one it is

look at bands list of what they are, and mention what bands are available (red, green , swir etc)

emphasize that this is predictor
All 9 available bands of all 4 Landsat scenes amounted to 36 input variables. Each pixel is an observation,
mention google map layer

pixels vs polygons, split by polygons
kind of gloss over diff # of pixels and randomization

---

# Decision Trees

very simple decision tree

???
think flow chart

talk about structure and how data gets fed through it 
mention that to build one it's a matter of deciding which variables to split on & there are metrics on

talk about prediction here

---

Random forest as a collection of decision trees

---

Randomness

Bootstrap resampling

random set of vars @each split

Think about hwo you have two audiences

---

# Out-of-Bag Error

???

# Tuning Parameters

???
maybe mention more than ntree briefly
get list of default values of other params

to see how the forests perform using these metrics so you can understand the plots.......

# Accuracy Assessment

<br>
$$\text{Overall Accuracy}= \text{OA}= \frac{\text{number of correctly classified reference sites}}{\text{total number of reference sites}}$$
--

<br>
$$F_1\text{ Score} = 2*\frac{UA*PA}{UA+PA}$$
--

<br>
$$UA(z)\ = \frac{\text{number of correctly identified pixels in class z}}{\text{total number of pixels identified as class z}}$$ 
--

<br>
$$PA(z) = \frac{\text{number of correctly identified pixels in class z}}{\text{number of pixels truly in class z}}$$

???

make sure to iterate how people should interpret F1 (close to 1 is good)

In line with the methods used in our reference paper and the remote sensing field, accuracy metrics will include the following:

$OA_{urb}$ and $OA_{nat}$ will be used, which are the same as overall $OA$ but only includes the urban and natural classes, respectively.

$UA$ is a measure of user's accuracy, which is also called precision or positive predictive value. $PA$ is the measure of producer's accuracy, also known as recall or sensitivity. The harmonic mean of $UA$ and $PA$ gives the $F_1$ score, which is a measure of the model's accuracy. An $F_1$ Score closer to 1 indicates a model that has both low false positives and low false negatives.

make title fit conclusion (accuracy improves with ntree up to 125)

start with x axis is
y axis is
colors mean
THEN takeaway
visual phenomenon of leveling off, this means the accuracy is improving but only to a point

# Results: OA for 5 to 500

The parameter for the number of trees was initially varied between 5 and 500 at intervals of 5. The resulting overall accuracy metrics indicate a leveling off around 125 trees (Figure 2). There's also a clear distinction between accuracy in urban vs. natural classes, with natural classes having a much higher overall accuracy.

transition to it beeing same structure but f1 score and classes

add takeaway for title instead

# Results: F-1 by Class 5 to 500

The variation between LCZ classes in F-1 score can be seen. As the number of trees in the random forest increases, F-1 score also increases, until around 100 trees. These metrics were calculated based on the out-of-bag dataset.

include larger plots for 500-2500 or just mention? Probably just mentio

give some accuracy numbers for test accuracy plot comparison later

add takeaway

<img src="../../results/plots/png_test_set_validation_metrics_barplot_separated.png">

???

these are all lower than the out of bag estimate, "remember what it was before that I mentioned"

## Predicting on the Test Dataset

OA and F-1 metrics dropped dramatically upon applying the random forest to the test data (Figure 4).

Accuracy among random forest predictions for the test dataset varied widely, but was lower than expected for F-1 scores, which do not seem to agree with the OA metrics. Classes 2, 5, 8, and 14 have particularly low F-1 Scores

There is not a clear pattern in Mean Decrease for Gini Impurity between the different bands and scenes, though there is some indication that bands in scene 4 were particularly effective as predictors.

# Conclusion

Overall Results:
* Low accuracy for prediction on the test data, in comparison to the out-of-bag data
* High OA values can mask low F1 scores within classes

--

<br>
Limitations:
* Reference polygons on account for ~3% of the Area of Interest
* Time constraints
--

<br>
Future Work:
* Multiple tuning parameters & Interactions between them
* Quantifying "how much" ground truth data is enough
