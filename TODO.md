# Milestones

### Prior to Winter Quarter (Dec. 9 - Jan. 1)

* [x] Find resources on random forests
* [x] Dive into data


### Week 1 (Jan. 4-8)

* [ ] Set up weekly meetings
* [ ] Create weekly work schedule (i.e. timing of work sessions)
* [ ] Address expected data preprocessing challenges
    * [ ] Pick a city to start with
    * [ ] Get Landsat images from USGS Earth Explorer for  that city on it's two dates
    * [ ] Clip image to cover city
    * [ ] Figure out what ENVI FLAASH is
    * [ ] Read about bilinear reampling with spatial data
* [ ] Solidify plan of attack for data preprocessing

### Week 2 (Jan. 11-15)

* [ ] Schedule Oral Exam 
* [ ] Start writing background info/introduction
* [ ] Go through 2+ random forest resources
* [ ] Data preprocessing steps
     * [ ] Use ENVI FLAASH on the chosen city images.
     * [ ] Play around with the resampling methods. Can you match it up to their steps? 
     * [ ] Determine how you get raster data into R.
     * [ ] Determine how you choose to only use certain bands as input data? Can you just filter it? 
     * [ ] Strategize how to randomly and evenly divide the polygons. Test if time allows
