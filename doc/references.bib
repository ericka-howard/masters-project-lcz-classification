	abstract = {The effect of urban development on local thermal climate is widely documented in scientific literature. Observations of urban–rural air temperature differences—or urban heat islands ({UHIs})—have been reported for cities and regions worldwide, often with local field sites that are extremely diverse in their physical and climatological characteristics. These sites are usually described only as “urban” or “rural,” leaving much uncertainty about the actual exposure and land cover of the sites. To address the inadequacies of urban–rural description, the “local climate zone” ({LCZ}) classification system has been developed. The {LCZ} system comprises 17 zone types at the local scale (102 to 104 m). Each type is unique in its combination of surface structure, cover, and human activity. Classification of sites into appropriate {LCZs} requires basic metadata and surface characterization. The zone definitions provide a standard framework for reporting and comparing field sites and their temperature observations. The {LCZ} system is designed primarily for urban heat island researchers, but it has derivative uses for city planners, landscape ecologists, and global climate change investigators.},

	abstract = {Local climate zone ({LCZ}) mapping is an emerging ﬁeld in urban climate research. {LCZs} potentially provide an objective framework to assess urban form and function worldwide. The scheme is currently being used to globally map {LCZs} as a part of the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools ({WUDAPT}) initiative. So far, most of the {LCZ} maps lack proper quantitative assessment, challenging the generic character of the {WUDAPT} workﬂow. Using the standard method introduced by the {WUDAPT} community diﬃculties arose concerning the built zones due to high levels of heterogeneity. To overcome this problem a contextual classiﬁer is adopted in the mapping process. This paper quantitatively assesses the inﬂuence of neighbourhood information on the {LCZ} mapping result of three cities in Belgium: Antwerp, Brussels and Ghent. Overall accuracies for the maps were respectively 85.7 ± 0.5, 79.6 ± 0.9, 90.2 ± 0.4\%. The approach presented here results in overall accuracies of 93.6 ± 0.2, 92.6 ± 0.3 and 95.6 ± 0.3\% for Antwerp, Brussels and Ghent. The results thus indicate a positive inﬂuence of neighbourhood information for all study areas with an increase in overall accuracies of 7.9, 13.0 and 5.4\%. This paper reaches two main conclusions. Firstly, evidence was introduced on the relevance of a quantitative accuracy assessment in {LCZ} mapping, showing that the accuracies reported in previous papers are not easily achieved. Secondly, the method presented in this paper proves to be highly eﬀective in Belgian cities, and given its open character shows promise for application in other heterogeneous cities worldwide.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the scientiﬁc outcomes of the 2017 Data Fusion Contest organized by the Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee of the {IEEE} Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society. The 2017 Contest was aimed at addressing the problem of local climate zones classiﬁcation based on a multitemporal and multimodal dataset, including image (Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2) and vector data (from {OpenStreetMap}). The competition, based on separate geographical locations for the training and testing of the proposed solution, aimed at models that were accurate (assessed by accuracy metrics on an undisclosed reference for the test cities), general (assessed by spreading the test cities across the globe), and computationally feasible (assessed by having a test phase of limited time). The techniques proposed by the participants to the Contest spanned across a rather broad range of topics, and of mixed ideas and methodologies deriving from computer vision and machine learning but also deeply rooted in the speciﬁcities of remote sensing. In particular, rigorous atmospheric correction, the use of multidate images, and the use of ensemble methods fusing results obtained from different data sources/time instants made the difference.},

	abstract = {The Local Climate Zone ({LCZ}) scheme is a classification system providing a standardization framework to present the characteristics of urban forms and functions, especially for urban heat island ({UHI}) research. Landsat-based 100 m resolution {LCZ} maps have been classified by the World Urban Database and Portal Tool ({WUDAPT}) method using a random forest ({RF}) machine learning classifier. Some studies have proposed modified {RF} and convolutional neural network ({CNN}) approaches. This study aims to compare {CNN} with an {RF} classifier for {LCZ} mapping in great detail. We designed five schemes (three {RF}-based schemes (S1–S3) and two {CNN}-based ones (S4–S5)), which consist of various combinations of input features from bitemporal Landsat 8 data over four global mega cities: Rome, Hong Kong, Madrid, and Chicago. Among the five schemes, the {CNN}-based one with the incorporation of a larger neighborhood information showed the best classification performance. When compared to the {WUDAPT} workflow, the overall accuracies for entire land cover classes ({OA}) and for urban {LCZ} types (i.e., {LCZ}1-10; {OAurb}) increased by about 6–8\% and 10–13\%, respectively, for the four cities. The transferability of {LCZ} models for the four cities were evaluated, showing that {CNN} consistently resulted in higher accuracy (increased by about 7–18\% and 18–29\% for {OA} and {OAurb}, respectively) than {RF}. This study revealed that the {CNN} classifier classified particularly well for the specific {LCZ} classes in which buildings were mixed with trees or buildings or plants were sparsely distributed. The research findings can provide a basis for guidance of future {LCZ} classification using deep learning.},

This paper presents a framework for discussion of various estimators, uses the framework to make the case for a particular estimator, and then uses the framework to examine possible shortcomings of other estimators which appear in the literature. The measure recommended consists of differences between observations, from urban and pre-urban periods, first stratified by synoptic weather type. The measures whose shortcomings are examined are 1) contemporaneous urban-rural differences, 2) contemporaneous upwind-downwind differences, 3) contemporaneous urban-regional ratios, 4) time trends of differences and ratios and 5) contemporaneous weekday-weekend differences. The paper is designated as a “problem analysis” because its goal is general facilitation of discussion about the problem of empirical estimation of urban effects on climate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Knowledge Discovery in Databases ({KDD}) is an active and important research area with the promise for a high payoff in many business and scientiﬁc applications. One of the main tasks in {KDD} is classiﬁcation. A particular efﬁcient method for classiﬁcation is decision tree induction. The selection of the attribute used at each node of the tree to split the data (split criterion) is crucial in order to correctly classify objects. Different split criteria were proposed in the literature (Information Gain, Gini Index, etc.). It is not obvious which of them will produce the best decision tree for a given data set. A large amount of empirical tests were conducted in order to answer this question. No conclusive results were found. In this paper we introduce a formal methodology, which allows us to compare multiple split criteria. This permits us to present fundamental insights into the decision process. Furthermore, we are able to present a formal description of how to select between split criteria for a given data set. As an illustration we apply the methodology to two widely used split criteria: Gini Index and Information Gain.},

	abstract = {The World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools ({WUDAPT}) is a community initiative to collect worldwide data on urban form (i.e., morphology, materials) and function (i.e., use and metabolism). This is achieved through crowdsourcing, which we deﬁne here as the collection of data by a bounded crowd, composed of students. In this process, training data for the classiﬁcation of urban structures into Local Climate Zones ({LCZ}) are obtained, which are, like most volunteered geographic information initiatives, of unknown quality. In this study, we investigated the quality of 94 crowdsourced training datasets for ten cities, generated by 119 students from six universities. The results showed large discrepancies and the resulting {LCZ} maps were mostly of poor to moderate quality. This was due to general difﬁculties in the human interpretation of the (urban) landscape and in the understanding of the {LCZ} scheme. However, the quality of the {LCZ} maps improved with the number of training data revisions. As evidence for the wisdom of the crowd, improvements of up to 20\% in overall accuracy were found when multiple training datasets were used together to create a single {LCZ} map. This improvement was greatest for small training datasets, saturating at about ten to ﬁfteen sets.},
